# wtf-docker

Code examples of [docker](https://www.docker.com/) working with environment variables.

Environment variables have many methods of being defined and overridden.

The documentation of all of the methods is sparse, this is an attempt to resolve that.

- [Example 1 - Using `run` command](example-1/example1.md)
- [Example 2 - Using docker Compose files](example-2/example2.md)
- [Example 3 - Using docker .env files](example-3/example3.md)
